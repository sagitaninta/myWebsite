I am currently a PhD student at the [Biology Department](https://www.qmul.ac.uk/sbcs/about-us/our-departments/biology/) of Queen Mary University of London, under the supervision of [Laurent Frantz](https://www.qmul.ac.uk/sbcs/staff/laurentfrantz.html) studying how genomics could improve conservation practices. My research interests include evolutionary biology, conservation genetics, and biodiversity informatics. I find joy in seeking pattern from data and building my skill in multivariate statistics and mathematical modelling. I keep up with the current progress of Evolurion and Ecology also by being a Tutor for [Indonesian Biology Olympiad Team](http://tobi.or.id).

My concern for the sustainable use of natural resources led me to co-founded and develop [Tambora Muda Indonesia](http://www.tamboramuda.org), a network for Indonesian young conservationists which I co-founded with my friends to coach young Indonesian conservationists to contribute to conservation practices. I am currently the Head of Database and Human Resources there and accept freelance work in data analysis and research.
