I am currently a PhD student at the [Biology Department](https://www.qmul.ac.uk/sbcs/about-us/our-departments/biology/) of Queen Mary University of London, under the supervision of [Laurent Frantz](https://www.qmul.ac.uk/sbcs/staff/laurentfrantz.html) studying how genomics could improve conservation practices. My research interests include evolutionary biology, conservation genetics, and biodiversity informatics. I find joy in seeking pattern from data and building my skill in multivariate statistics and mathematical modelling. I keep up with the current progress of Evolution and Ecology also by being a member of scientific committee for [Indonesian Biology Olympiad Team](http://tobi.or.id).

My concern for the sustainable use of natural resources led me to co-founded and develop [Tambora Muda Indonesia](http://www.tamboramuda.org), a network for Indonesian young conservationists which I co-founded with my friends to coach young Indonesian conservationists to contribute to conservation practices. If you are interested in investing for aspiring young conservationists in Indonesia, feel free to contact me or my friends at info[at]tamboramuda.org
